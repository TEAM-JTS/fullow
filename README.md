FULLOW is a one-stop destination for fans of any particular NBA player. 

The app aggregates the verified social content of current NBA players, leverages the APIs of some popular social websites, and uses some scraping magic to produce a single dashboard for the user. 

Upon first visit to the app, a user will be presented with a selection (or search) for NBA players.
